\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirements of action branch}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Localisation and path planning of a non-\/holonomic robot in an environment with Gazebo and Coppelia simulators. Taking the code in the main branch i want to replace the go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point service with an action service by custom action message Position.\+action. In this way the user can stop the robot in whatever place wants, instead of stopping the robot once it reaches the target goal. Infact implementing the action service is possible to cancel the goal once the user press 0 and set the velocity of the robot equal to zero in order to stop it.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{What you can find in this branch}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In this branch you can find two nodes in python and two nodes in C++\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point.\+py is an action server used to reach the position of a random target. In this script is implemented the behaviour of an Finite State Machine in order to\+: 1) align the robot with the goal 2) move the robot in the direction of the goal 3) once the goal is reached the robot align its orientation with the goal\textquotesingle{}s orientation This node uses a publisher in order to publish the velocity of the robot ~\newline
 on /cmd\+\_\+vel topic and it uses a subscriber in order to check the robot\textquotesingle{}s position on /odom topic.
\item user\+\_\+interface.\+py implements an user interface in order to start or stop the robot. In particular it is a client that reads the user command and via custom service message Command.\+srv send it to the state\+\_\+machine node. When the user press 1 the node sends a \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} messagge to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceuser__interface}{user\+\_\+interface}} server. Instead if the user press 0 the node the function of go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point is stopped and in state\+\_\+machine node the goal is cancelled, setting also the velocity to zero.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}} is a simple server that has the scope of generate a random target. This node infact generate three random components (x and y components for the position, theta component for the orientation) in a specified interval \mbox{[}min,max\mbox{]} via custom service message Random\+Position.\+srv.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}} is a node wich communicates with all other nodes, in particular\+: 1) a client is generated in order to set the fields of the random target and send the request to position\+\_\+service 2) The node implements a function callback of the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceuser__interface}{user\+\_\+interface}} , in order to check the request done by the user, setting properly the value of the variable start. 3) Implements an action client in order to cancel the goal if the user decides to stop the robot. 4) Publish on topic /cmd\+\_\+vel the velocity equal to zero if the user decides to stop the robot.
\item A coppelia scene in order to launch the simulation also in Coppelia (Vrep).

In the notebook folder you can find User\+\_\+\+Interface.\+ipynb file. In particular this file is the graphical user interface developed with Jupiter Notebook. Is also delevoped real-\/time graphs of the robot behavior. In order to start the notebook execute\+:

Then open web browser at localhost\+:8888 and select the notebook. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}

\item starting / stopping the robot “random position” behaviour by using two Buttons
\item setting the linear and angular velocity by using two sliders-\/
\item directly controlling the robot movements by using 5 Buttons\+: forward, turn right, backward, turn left, stop

\item a line plot for visualizing cmd\+\_\+vel vs. actual velocity for linear and angular velocity
\item a bar plot displaying the number of reached targets and cancelled targets
\item a hist plot showing the time required to reach targets

Sphinx documentation has been developed. You can find it into docs folder\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Launch files}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
In the folder launch you can find two launch file\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sim.\+launch starts the simulation launching Gazebo simulator, with an empty map and loading the Universal Robot desciption on it. It run all the four nodes above described.
\item sim\+Vrep.\+launch starts only the four nodes described above without launching Gazebo simulator and load the U\+R\+DF on the R\+OS server.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{How to launch the simulation in Gazebo}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
In order to launch the simulation on Gazebo copy and paste the following command on Ubuntu shall


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 sim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


 \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{How to launch the simulation on Vrep}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
In order to launch the simulation on Vrep\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads}
\end{DoxyCode}


Download the education version zip and unzip it, should be something as Coppelia\+Sim\+\_\+\+Edu\+\_\+\+V4\+\_\+2\+\_\+0\+\_\+\+Ubuntu20\+\_\+04. Then move into this folder and change the permission of the coppelia\+Sim.\+sh by digit 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{chmod +x coppeliaSim.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then in order to launch the simulation open another terminal and run the ros master then launch the executable of Coppelia 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roscore \&}
\DoxyCodeLine{./coppeliaSim.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


Check if R\+OS is correctly sourced before proceeds Then you must open the scene coppelia\+Scene.\+ttt, you should see a pioner mobile robot in the centre of the map Now to start the simulation open another terminal, move to the ros workspace and digit the follow command and start the simulation on Coppelia. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 simVrep.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you press 1 in order to start moving the robot you must see the pioner moves to reach the goal position. if you press 0 you must see the pioner stops in the current position. If the simulation is too slow click on the hare on the top.
